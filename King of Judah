Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.

Program Overview
Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.

Program Overview
Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.
Java Community Process Program Overview
The Java Community Process (JCP) program is the formalization of the open, inclusive
process that has been used since 1998 to develop and revise Java technology specifications,
reference implementations (RI), and technology compatibility kits (TCK). Javhttps://github.com/bradford80USA/unamed/actions/workflows/azure-container-webapp.yml**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.
Java Community Process Program Overview
The Java Community Process (JCP) program is the formalization of the open, inclusive
process that has been used since 1998 to develop and revise Java technology specifications,
reference implementations (RI), and technology compatibility kits (TCK). Jav1300

Integrations are tools that extend GitHub's functionality. Integrations can do things on GitHub like open issues, comment on pull requests, and manage projects. They can also do things outside of GitHub based on events that happen on GitHub. For example, an integration can post on Slack when an issue is opened on GitHub.

Many integrations are GitHub Apps, GitHub Actions workflows, or custom actions for GitHub Actions workflows.

    GitHub Apps are integrations that run on the app owner's server or on a user device. For more information, see "About creating GitHub Apps."
    GitHub Actions workflows are workflows that run when specific events occur on GitHub. For more information, see "Understanding GitHub Actions."
    Custom actions are code that can be executed by a GitHub Actions workflow. For more information, see "About custom actions."

Your integration can use GitHub's API to fetch data and make changes to data on GitHub. GitHub has a REST API and a GraphQL API. For more information, see:

    "Comparing GitHub's REST API and GraphQL API"
    "GitHub REST API documentation"
    "GitHub GraphQL API documentation"

Your integration can use webhooks to learn when specific events happen on GitHub. For more information, see "About webhooks."

If your integration is a GitHub App or custom action, you can publish your integration on GitHub Marketplace. For more information, see "About GitHub Marketplace for apps" and "Publishing actions in GitHub MarkeStart a new codespace.

In this lab, you will build upon the dry-run command to override GitHub Actions Importer's default behavior and customize the converted workflow using "custom transformers." Custom transformers can be used to:

Convert items that are not automatically converted.
Convert items that were automatically converted using different actions.
Convert environment variable values differently.
Convert references to runners to use a different runner name in GitHub Actions.
Prerequisites
Followed the steps here to set up your GitHub Codespaces environment.
Completed the configure lab.
Completed the dry-run lab.
Perform a dry run
You will be performing a dry-run command to inspect the workflow that is converted by default. Run the following command within the codespace terminal:

gh actions-importer dry-run bitbucket --output-dir tmp/dry-run --workspace actions-importer --repository node-deploy --source-file-path ./bitbucket/bootstrap/source_files/node_deploy.yml
The converted workflow that is generated by the above command can be seen below:

Converted workflow 👇
Note: You can refer to the previous lab to learn about the fundamentals of the dry-run command.

Custom transformers for an unknown step
The converted workflow above contains a atlassian/unknown-azure-deploy step that was not automatically converted. Let's write a custom transformer to handle this unknown pipe!

Let's answer the following questions before proceeding to write a custom transformer.

What is the "identifier" of the step to customize? This should be the identifier from the comment in the workflow without the version, or in other words the name of the pipe.
atlassian/unknown-azure-deploy
What is the desired Actions syntax to use instead?
Upon conducting some research, you've discovered that the Azure Web App and Azure Login actions available in the marketplace offer comparable functionality.

  with:
    creds: "${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"

Now you can begin to write the custom transformer. Custom transformers use a DSL built on top of Ruby and should be defined in a file with the .rb file extension. You can create this file by running the following command in your codespace terminal:

touch transformers.rb && code transformersmy-package.ziptransformers.rbIntegrations are tools that extend GitHub's functionality. Integrations can do things on GitHub like open issues, comment on pull requests, and manage projects. They can also do things outside of GitHub based on events that happen on GitHub. For example, an integration can post on Slack when an issue is opened on GitHub.

Many integrations are GitHub Apps, GitHub Actions workflows, or custom actions for GitHub Actions workflows.

    GitHub Apps are integrations that run on the app owner's server or on a user device. For more information, see "About creating GitHub Apps."
    GitHub Actions workflows are workflows that run when specific events occur on GitHub. For more information, see "Understanding GitHub Actions."
    Custom actions are code that can be executed by a GitHub Actions workflow. For more information, see "About custom actions."

Your integration can use GitHub's API to fetch data and make changes to data on GitHub. GitHub has a REST API and a GraphQL API. For more information, see:

    "Comparing GitHub's REST API and GraphQL API"
    "GitHub REST API documentation"
    "GitHub GraphQL API documentation"

Your integration can use webhooks to learn when specific events happen on GitHub. For more information, see "About webhooks."

If your integration is a GitHub App or custom action, you can publish your integration on GitHub Marketplace. For more information, see "About GitHub Marketplace for apps" and "Publishing actions in GitHub MarkeStart a new codespace.

Verify GitHub Actions Importer CLI extension is installed and working by running the following command from the codespace terminal:

gh actions-importer versionhttps://dev.azure.com/:organization1https://dev.azure.com/:organization/:projectIn this lab, you will build upon the dry-run command to override GitHub Actions Importer's default behavior and customize the converted workflow using "custom transformers." Custom transformers can be used to:

Convert items that are not automatically converted.
Convert items that were automatically converted using different actions.
Convert environment variable values differently.
Convert references to runners to use a different runner name in GitHub Actions.
Prerequisites
Followed the steps here to set up your GitHub Codespaces environment.
Completed the configure lab.
Completed the dry-run lab.
Perform a dry run
You will be performing a dry-run command to inspect the workflow that is converted by default. Run the following command within the codespace terminal:

gh actions-importer dry-run bitbucket --output-dir tmp/dry-run --workspace actions-importer --repository node-deploy --source-file-path ./bitbucket/bootstrap/source_files/node_deploy.yml
The converted workflow that is generated by the above command can be seen below:

Converted workflow 👇
Note: You can refer to the previous lab to learn about the fundamentals of the dry-run command.

Custom transformers for an unknown step
The converted workflow above contains a atlassian/unknown-azure-deploy step that was not automatically converted. Let's write a custom transformer to handle this unknown pipe!

Let's answer the following questions before proceeding to write a custom transformer.

What is the "identifier" of the step to customize? This should be the identifier from the comment in the workflow without the version, or in other words the name of the pipe.
atlassian/unknown-azure-deploy
What is the desired Actions syntax to use instead?
Upon conducting some research, you've discovered that the Azure Web App and Azure Login actions available in the marketplace offer comparable functionality.
- uses: azure/login@v1.4.6
  with:
    creds: "${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
- uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2.2.5
  with:
    app-name: my-site
    package: my-package.zip
    resource-group-name: "$AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP"
Now you can begin to write the custom transformer. Custom transformers use a DSL built on top of Ruby and should be defined in a file with the .rb file extension. You can create this file by running the following command in your codespace terminal:

systems
zkSync currently can be launched on any *nix operating system (e.g. any linux distribution or MacOS).

If you're using Windows, then make sure to use WSL 2, since WSL 1 is known to cause troubles.

Additionally, if you are going to use WSL 2, make sure that your project is located in the linux filesystem, since accessing NTFS partitions from inside of WSL is very slow.

If you're using MacOS with an ARM processor (e.g. M1/M2), make sure that you are working in the native environment (e.g. your terminal and IDE don't run in Rosetta, and your toolchain is native). Trying to work with zkSync code via Rosetta may cause problems that are hard to spot and debug, so make sure to check everything before you start.

If you are a NixOS user or would like to have a reproducible environment, skip to the section about nix.

Docker
Install docker. It is recommended to follow the instructions from the official site.

Note: currently official site proposes using Docker Desktop for linux, which is a GUI tool with plenty of quirks. If you want to only have CLI tool, you need the docker-ce package and you can follow this guide for Ubuntu.

Installing docker via snap or from the default repository can cause troubles.

You need to install both docker and docker-compose.

Note: docker-compose is installed automatically with Docker Desktop.

Note: On linux you may encounter the following error when you’ll try to work with zksync:

ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run `docker-machine start default`.
If so, you do not need to install docker-machine. Most probably, it means that your user is not added to thedocker group. You can check it as follows:

docker-compose up # Should raise the same error.
sudo docker-compose up # Should start doing things.
If the first command fails, but the second succeeds, then you need to add your user to the docker group:

sudo usermod -a -G docker your_user_name
After that, you should logout and login again (user groups are refreshed after the login). The problem should be solved at this step.

If logging out does not help, restarting the computer should.

Node & Yarn
Install Node (requires version v18.18.0). Since our team attempts to always use the latest LTS version of Node.js, we suggest you to install nvm. It will allow you to update Node.js version easily in the future (by running nvm use in the root of the repository)
Install yarn (make sure to get version 1.22.19 - you can change the version by running yarn set version 1.22.19). Instructions can be found on the official site.
Check if yarn is installed by running yarn -v. If you face any problems when installing yarn, it might be the case that your package manager installed the wrong package.Make sure to thoroughly follow the instructions above on the official website. It contains a lot of troubleshooting guides in it.
Axel
Install axel for downloading keys:

On mac:

brew install axel
On debian-based linux:

sudo apt-get install axel
Check the version of axel with the following command:

axel --version
Make sure the version is higher than 2.17.10.

clang
In order to compile RocksDB, you must have LLVM available. On debian-based linux it can be installed as follows:

On linux:

sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config cmake clang lldb lld
On mac:

You need to have an up-to-date Xcode. You can install it directly from App Store. With Xcode command line tools, you get the Clang compiler installed by default. Thus, having XCode you don't need to install clang.

OpenSSL
Install OpenSSL:

On mac:

brew install openssl
On linux:

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
Rust
Install the latest rust version.

Instructions can be found on the official site.

Verify the rust installation:

rustc --version
rustc 1.xx.y (xxxxxx 20xx-yy-zz) # Output may vary depending on actual version of rust
If you are using MacOS with ARM processor (e.g. M1/M2), make sure that you use an aarch64 toolchain. For example, when you run rustup show, you should see a similar input:

rustup show
Default host: aarch64-apple-darwin
rustup home:  /Users/user/.rustup

SQLx CLI
SQLx is a Rust library we use to interact with Postgres, and its CLI is used to manage DB migrations and support several features of the library.

cargo install sqlx-cli --version 0.5.13
Solidity compiler solc
Install the latest solidity compiler.

brew install solidity
Alternatively, download a precompiled version and add it to your PATH.

Python
Most environments will have this preinstalled but if not, install Python.

Easier method using nix

Install nix. Enable the nix command and flakes.

Install docker, rustup and use rust to install SQLx CLI like described above. If you are on NixOS, you also need to enable nix-ld.

Go to the zksync folder and run nix develop --impure. After it finishes, you are in a shell that has all the dependencies.

Environment
Edit the lines below and add them to your shell profile file (e.g. ~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc):

# Add path here:
export ZKSYNC_HOME=/path/to/zksync

export PATH=$ZKSYNC_HOME/bin:$PATH

# If you're like me, uncomment:

zkSync currently can be launched on any *nix operating system (e.g. any linux distribution or MacOS).

If you're using Windows, then make sure to use WSL 2, since WSL 1 is known to cause troubles.

Additionally, if you are going to use WSL 2, make sure that your project is located in the linux filesystem, since accessing NTFS partitions from inside of WSL is very slow.

If you're using MacOS with an ARM processor (e.g. M1/M2), make sure that you are working in the native environment (e.g. your terminal and IDE don't run in Rosetta, and your toolchain is native). Trying to work with zkSync code via Rosetta may cause problems that are hard to spot and debug, so make sure to check everything before you start.

If you are a NixOS user or would like to have a reproducible environment, skip to the section about nix.

Docker
Install docker. It is recommended to follow the instructions from the official site.

Note: currently official site proposes using Docker Desktop for linux, which is a GUI tool with plenty of quirks. If you want to only have CLI tool, you need the docker-ce package and you can follow this guide for Ubuntu.

Installing docker via snap or from the default repository can cause troubles.

You need to install both docker and docker-compose.

Note: docker-compose is installed automatically with Docker Desktop.

Note: On linux you may encounter the following error when you’ll try to work with zksync:

ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run `docker-machine start default`.
If so, you do not need to install docker-machine. Most probably, it means that your user is not added to thedocker group. You can check it as follows:

docker-compose up # Should raise the same error.
sudo docker-compose up # Should start doing things.
If the first command fails, but the second succeeds, then you need to add your user to the docker group:

sudo usermod -a -G docker your_user_name
After that, you should logout and login again (user groups are refreshed after the login). The problem should be solved at this step.

If logging out does not help, restarting the computer should.

Node & Yarn
Install Node (requires version v18.18.0). Since our team attempts to always use the latest LTS version of Node.js, we suggest you to install nvm. It will allow you to update Node.js version easily in the future (by running nvm use in the root of the repository)
Install yarn (make sure to get version 1.22.19 - you can change the version by running yarn set version 1.22.19). Instructions can be found on the official site.
Check if yarn is installed by running yarn -v. If you face any problems when installing yarn, it might be the case that your package manager installed the wrong package.Make sure to thoroughly follow the instructions above on the official website. It contains a lot of troubleshooting guides in it.
Axel
Install axel for downloading keys:

On mac:

brew install axel
On debian-based linux:

sudo apt-get install axel
Check the version of axel with the following command:

axel --version
Make sure the version is higher than 2.17.10.

clang
In order to compile RocksDB, you must have LLVM available. On debian-based linux it can be installed as follows:

On linux:

sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config cmake clang lldb lld
On mac:

You need to have an up-to-date Xcode. You can install it directly from App Store. With Xcode command line tools, you get the Clang compiler installed by default. Thus, having XCode you don't need to install clang.

OpenSSL
Install OpenSSL:

On mac:

brew install openssl
On linux:

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
Rust
Install the latest rust version.

Instructions can be found on the official site.

Verify the rust installation:

rustc --version
rustc 1.xx.y (xxxxxx 20xx-yy-zz) # Output may vary depending on actual version of rust
If you are using MacOS with ARM processor (e.g. M1/M2), make sure that you use an aarch64 toolchain. For example, when you run rustup show, you should see a similar input:

rustup show
Default host: aarch64-apple-darwin
rustup home:  /Users/user/.rustup

The training experience of DeepSpeed-VisualChat is straightforward and convenient. Here we give an example based on the CLIP visual encoder and the LLaMa-7B model:

git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples.git
cd DeepSpeedExamples/applications/DeepSpeed-VisualChat/
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd training
bash training_scripts/run_7b.sh
The trained checkpoint will be automatically saved in a Hugging Face-compatible version and can be used to launch your own visual chat API:

cd ../chat
bash chat_scripts/run.sh # You need to change necessary variables, e.g, ckpt path
To support larger model inference, we have incorporated Hugging Face large model inference into our DeepSpeed-VisualChat API. Therefore, users can choose a different number of GPUs based on the GPU memory capacity and the model size.

1. Overview
Large Language models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLaMa, have showcased exceptional prowess in a myriad of text generation and comprehension tasks, especially when subjected to zero-/few-shot learning, particularly after instructed fine-tuning. However, to equip AI agents for diverse tasks, one critical feature that needs to be incorporated is multi-modal capability; for instance, the AI agent should be able to read images, hear voices, watch videos, etc. This capability is largely absent in solely text-based LLMs.

Recently, one of the research/practice mainstreams has begun exploring the incorporation of visual capability into LLMs, especially enabling LLMs to understand images by inserting raw pictures (referred to as large visual language models, or LVLMs in short).

The main caveats of the majority of existing works are:

The focus is predominantly on tasks related to a single image, such as visual question answering and captioning, or on handling multiple images that require concurrent input. Neither approach adeptly manages interleaved image-and-text input.
The scalability of the system is limited to models with ~10B parameters, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than largest open-sourced models.
However, for a genuine AI chat agent, the content of inputs could be multiple images interleaved with text, a situation rarely addressed by current works. Also, the generation capability of LLMs grows quickly as the model size increases. Therefore, focusing system capability on ~10B models limits further exploration of the potential of LVLMs.

To resolve these issues, we are introducing DeepSpeed-VisualChat (see arxiv report for more details) with the following new features:

Fully Open-Sourced Multi-round Multi-image Framework with Unprecedented Scalability: DeepSpeed-VisualChat, one of the pioneering fully open-sourced frameworks, enables multi-round and multi-image dialogues, accommodating interleaved text-and-image inputs. We leverage DeepSpeed to enhance our training with a 2B visual encoder and a 70B LLaMA-2 decoder model, illustrating the remarkable scalability of our framework.
Multi-Modal Causal Attention (MMCA) We devise a novel MMCA for multi-modal models that computes attention weights independently across various modalities. MMCA achieves objectives analogous to conventional cross-attention mechanisms but offers enhanced causal attention interpretations for generative tasks, eliminating the need for additional modules or parameters. It also presents superior training data efficiency compared to standard causal attention.
Data Blending for Interleaved Inputs To facilitate conversations with interleaved modalities, DeepSpeed-VisualChat employs assorted data blending techniques on existing datasets, overcoming the shortage of interleaved text-and-image inputs in most available open-source datasets.

It seems like you're referring to two separate equations. If you want to implement these in JavaScript, you can create functions like this:

```javascript
// src/utils/equations.js
const equation1 = (x, y) => {
  return -5 * Math.pow(x, 2) * Math.pow(y, 2) + 1;
};

const equation2 = (x) => {
  return 3 * Math.pow(x, 2) - 5 * x + 4;
};

export { equation1, equation2 };
```

You can use these functions like this:

```javascript
import { equation1, equation2 } from './utils/equations';

const x = 2;
const y = 3;

const result1 = equation1(x, y);
console.log(result1); // outputs the result of the first equation for x=2, y=3

const result2 = equation2(x);
console.log(result2); // outputs the result of the second equation for x=2
```

These functions calculate the values of the equations `-5x^2y^2 + 1` and `3x^2 - 5x + 4`.

for x=2,4,=3
const result1+2=equation
2(x); console.log(result1);outputs the
result of the

equations 2} from:/utis|s/equations;

                       const x=2
                       const y=3
const result1+1=equation1 (x);
console.log(result1);//output's the
results of 3 first equation for x=2,y=3

The training experience of DeepSpeed-VisualChat is straightforward and convenient. Here we give an example based on the CLIP visual encoder and the LLaMa-7B model:

git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples.git
cd DeepSpeedExamples/applications/DeepSpeed-VisualChat/
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd training
bash training_scripts/run_7b.sh
The trained checkpoint will be automatically saved in a Hugging Face-compatible version and can be used to launch your own visual chat API:

cd ../chat
bash chat_scripts/run.sh # You need to change necessary variables, e.g, ckpt path
To support larger model inference, we have incorporated Hugging Face large model inference into our DeepSpeed-VisualChat API. Therefore, users can choose a different number of GPUs based on the GPU memory capacity and the model size.

1. Overview
Large Language models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLaMa, have showcased exceptional prowess in a myriad of text generation and comprehension tasks, especially when subjected to zero-/few-shot learning, particularly after instructed fine-tuning. However, to equip AI agents for diverse tasks, one critical feature that needs to be incorporated is multi-modal capability; for instance, the AI agent should be able to read images, hear voices, watch videos, etc. This capability is largely absent in solely text-based LLMs.

Recently, one of the research/practice mainstreams has begun exploring the incorporation of visual capability into LLMs, especially enabling LLMs to understand images by inserting raw pictures (referred to as large visual language models, or LVLMs in short).

The main caveats of the majority of existing works are:

The focus is predominantly on tasks related to a single image, such as visual question answering and captioning, or on handling multiple images that require concurrent input. Neither approach adeptly manages interleaved image-and-text input.
The scalability of the system is limited to models with ~10B parameters, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than largest open-sourced models.
However, for a genuine AI chat agent, the content of inputs could be multiple images interleaved with text, a situation rarely addressed by current works. Also, the generation capability of LLMs grows quickly as the model size increases. Therefore, focusing system capability on ~10B models limits further exploration of the potential of LVLMs.

To resolve these issues, we are introducing DeepSpeed-VisualChat (see arxiv report for more details) with the following new features:

Fully Open-Sourced Multi-round Multi-image Framework with Unprecedented Scalability: DeepSpeed-VisualChat, one of the pioneering fully open-sourced frameworks, enables multi-round and multi-image dialogues, accommodating interleaved text-and-image inputs. We leverage DeepSpeed to enhance our training with a 2B visual encoder and a 70B LLaMA-2 decoder model, illustrating the remarkable scalability of our framework.
Multi-Modal Causal Attention (MMCA) We devise a novel MMCA for multi-modal models that computes attention weights independently across various modalities. MMCA achieves objectives analogous to conventional cross-attention mechanisms but offers enhanced causal attention interpretations for generative tasks, eliminating the need for additional modules or parameters. It also presents superior training data efficiency compared to standard causal attention.
Data Blending for Interleaved Inputs To facilitate conversations with interleaved modalities, DeepSpeed-VisualChat employs assorted data blending techniques on existing datasets, overcoming the shortage of interleaved text-and-image inputs in most available open-source datasets.

Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.
Java Community Process Program Overview
The Java Community Process (JCP) program is the formalization of the open, inclusive
process that has been used since 1998 to develop and revise Java technology specifications,
reference implementations (RI), and technology compatibility kits (TCK). Jav1300https://github.com/bradford80USA/unamed/actions/workflows/azure-container-webapp.yml1998350Program35013001998

The training experience of DeepSpeed-VisualChat is straightforward and convenient. Here we give an example based on the CLIP visual encoder and the LLaMa-7B model:

git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples.git
cd DeepSpeedExamples/applications/DeepSpeed-VisualChat/
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd training
bash training_scripts/run_7b.sh
The trained checkpoint will be automatically saved in a Hugging Face-compatible version and can be used to launch your own visual chat API:

cd ../chat
bash chat_scripts/run.sh # You need to change necessary variables, e.g, ckpt path
To support larger model inference, we have incorporated Hugging Face large model inference into our DeepSpeed-VisualChat API. Therefore, users can choose a different number of GPUs based on the GPU memory capacity and the model size.

1. Overview
Large Language models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLaMa, have showcased exceptional prowess in a myriad of text generation and comprehension tasks, especially when subjected to zero-/few-shot learning, particularly after instructed fine-tuning. However, to equip AI agents for diverse tasks, one critical feature that needs to be incorporated is multi-modal capability; for instance, the AI agent should be able to read images, hear voices, watch videos, etc. This capability is largely absent in solely text-based LLMs.

Recently, one of the research/practice mainstreams has begun exploring the incorporation of visual capability into LLMs, especially enabling LLMs to understand images by inserting raw pictures (referred to as large visual language models, or LVLMs in short).

The main caveats of the majority of existing works are:

The focus is predominantly on tasks related to a single image, such as visual question answering and captioning, or on handling multiple images that require concurrent input. Neither approach adeptly manages interleaved image-and-text input.
The scalability of the system is limited to models with ~10B parameters, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than largest open-sourced models.
However, for a genuine AI chat agent, the content of inputs could be multiple images interleaved with text, a situation rarely addressed by current works. Also, the generation capability of LLMs grows quickly as the model size increases. Therefore, focusing system capability on ~10B models limits further exploration of the potential of LVLMs.

To resolve these issues, we are introducing DeepSpeed-VisualChat (see arxiv report for more details) with the following new features:

Fully Open-Sourced Multi-round Multi-image Framework with Unprecedented Scalability: DeepSpeed-VisualChat, one of the pioneering fully open-sourced frameworks, enables multi-round and multi-image dialogues, accommodating interleaved text-and-image inputs. We leverage DeepSpeed to enhance our training with a 2B visual encoder and a 70B LLaMA-2 decoder model, illustrating the remarkable scalability of our framework.
Multi-Modal Causal Attention (MMCA) We devise a novel MMCA for multi-modal models that computes attention weights independently across various modalities. MMCA achieves objectives analogous to conventional cross-attention mechanisms but offers enhanced causal attention interpretations for generative tasks, eliminating the need for additional modules or parameters. It also presents superior training data efficiency compared to standard causal attention.
Data Blending for Interleaved Inputs To facilitate conversations with interleaved modalities, DeepSpeed-VisualChat employs assorted data blending techniques on existing datasets, overcoming the shortage of interleaved text-and-image inputs in most available open-source datasets.

Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.

The training experience of DeepSpeed-VisualChat is straightforward and convenient. Here we give an example based on the CLIP visual encoder and the LLaMa-7B model:

git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples.git
cd DeepSpeedExamples/applications/DeepSpeed-VisualChat/
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd training
bash training_scripts/run_7b.sh
The trained checkpoint will be automatically saved in a Hugging Face-compatible version and can be used to launch your own visual chat API:

cd ../chat
bash chat_scripts/run.sh # You need to change necessary variables, e.g, ckpt path
To support larger model inference, we have incorporated Hugging Face large model inference into our DeepSpeed-VisualChat API. Therefore, users can choose a different number of GPUs based on the GPU memory capacity and the model size.

1. Overview
Large Language models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLaMa, have showcased exceptional prowess in a myriad of text generation and comprehension tasks, especially when subjected to zero-/few-shot learning, particularly after instructed fine-tuning. However, to equip AI agents for diverse tasks, one critical feature that needs to be incorporated is multi-modal capability; for instance, the AI agent should be able to read images, hear voices, watch videos, etc. This capability is largely absent in solely text-based LLMs.

Recently, one of the research/practice mainstreams has begun exploring the incorporation of visual capability into LLMs, especially enabling LLMs to understand images by inserting raw pictures (referred to as large visual language models, or LVLMs in short).

The main caveats of the majority of existing works are:

The focus is predominantly on tasks related to a single image, such as visual question answering and captioning, or on handling multiple images that require concurrent input. Neither approach adeptly manages interleaved image-and-text input.
The scalability of the system is limited to models with ~10B parameters, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than largest open-sourced models.
However, for a genuine AI chat agent, the content of inputs could be multiple images interleaved with text, a situation rarely addressed by current works. Also, the generation capability of LLMs grows quickly as the model size increases. Therefore, focusing system capability on ~10B models limits further exploration of the potential of LVLMs.

To resolve these issues, we are introducing DeepSpeed-VisualChat (see arxiv report for more details) with the following new features:

Fully Open-Sourced Multi-round Multi-image Framework with Unprecedented Scalability: DeepSpeed-VisualChat, one of the pioneering fully open-sourced frameworks, enables multi-round and multi-image dialogues, accommodating interleaved text-and-image inputs. We leverage DeepSpeed to enhance our training with a 2B visual encoder and a 70B LLaMA-2 decoder model, illustrating the remarkable scalability of our framework.
Multi-Modal Causal Attention (MMCA) We devise a novel MMCA for multi-modal models that computes attention weights independently across various modalities. MMCA achieves objectives analogous to conventional cross-attention mechanisms but offers enhanced causal attention interpretations for generative tasks, eliminating the need for additional modules or parameters. It also presents superior training data efficiency compared to standard causal attention.
Data Blending for Interleaved Inputs To facilitate conversations with interleaved modalities, DeepSpeed-VisualChat employs assorted data blending techniques on existing datasets, overcoming the shortage of interleaved text-and-image inputs in most available open-source datasets.
