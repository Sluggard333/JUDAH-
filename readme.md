https://dev.azure.com/:organization configuring the GitHub Codespaces environment that you will use in these labs to learn how to use GitHub Actions Importer to migrate Azure DevOps pipelines to GitHub Actions.

These steps must be completed prior to starting other labs.

Create your own repository for these labs
Ensure that you have created a repository using actions/importer-labs as a template.
Configure your codespace
Start a new codespace.

Click the Code button on your repository's landing page.
Click the Codespaces tab.
Click Create codespaces on main to create the codespace.
After the codespace has initialized there will be a terminal present.
Verify the GitHub Actions Importer CLI is installed and working. More information on the GitHub Actions Importer extension for the official GitHub CLI can be found here.

Run the following command in the codespace terminal:

gh actions-importer version
Verify the output is similar to below.

$ gh actions-importer version
gh version 2.14.3 (2022-07-26)
gh actions-importer        github/gh-actions-importer v0.1.12
actions-importer/cli       unknown
If gh actions-importer version did not produce similar output, please refer to the troubleshooting section.

Bootstrap your Azure DevOps organization
Create an Azure DevOps personal access token (PAT):

Navigate to your existing organization (https://dev.azure.com/:organization) in your browser.
In the top right corner of the screen, click User settings.
Click Personal access tokens.
Select + New Token
Name your token, select the organization where you want to use the token, and set your token to automatically expire after a set number of days.
Select the following scopes (you may need to select Show all scopes at the bottom of the page to reveal all scopes):
Agents Pool: Read
Build: Read & execute
Code: Read & write
Project and Team: Read, write, & manage
Release: Read
Service Connections: Read
Task Groups: Read
Variable Groups: Read
Click Create.
Copy the generated API token and save it in a safe location.
Execute the Azure DevOps setup script that will create a new Azure DevOps project in your organization to be used in the following labs. This script should only be run once.

Run the following command from the codespace terminal, replacing the values accordingly:

:organization: the name of your existing Azure DevOps organization
:project: the name of the project to be created in your Azure DevOps organization
:access_token: the PAT created in step 1 above
./azure_devops/bootstrap/setup --organization :organization --project :project --access-token :access-token
Open the newly created Azure DevOps project in your browser (https://dev.azure.com/:organization/:project)

Once authenticated, you will see an Azure DevOps project with a few predefined pipelines.

Program Overview
Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.
Java Community Process Program Overview
The Java Community Process (JCP) program is the formalization of the open, inclusive
process that has been used since 1998 to develop and revise Java technology specifications,
reference implementations (RI), and technology compatibility kits (TCK). JavStart a new codespace

systems
zkSync currently can be launched on any *nix operating system (e.g. any linux distribution or MacOS).

If you're using Windows, then make sure to use WSL 2, since WSL 1 is known to cause troubles.

Additionally, if you are going to use WSL 2, make sure that your project is located in the linux filesystem, since accessing NTFS partitions from inside of WSL is very slow.

If you're using MacOS with an ARM processor (e.g. M1/M2), make sure that you are working in the native environment (e.g. your terminal and IDE don't run in Rosetta, and your toolchain is native). Trying to work with zkSync code via Rosetta may cause problems that are hard to spot and debug, so make sure to check everything before you start.

If you are a NixOS user or would like to have a reproducible environment, skip to the section about nix.

Docker
Install docker. It is recommended to follow the instructions from the official site.

Note: currently official site proposes using Docker Desktop for linux, which is a GUI tool with plenty of quirks. If you want to only have CLI tool, you need the docker-ce package and you can follow this guide for Ubuntu.

Installing docker via snap or from the default repository can cause troubles.

You need to install both docker and docker-compose.

Note: docker-compose is installed automatically with Docker Desktop.

Note: On linux you may encounter the following error when you’ll try to work with zksync:

ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run `docker-machine start default`.
If so, you do not need to install docker-machine. Most probably, it means that your user is not added to thedocker group. You can check it as follows:

docker-compose up # Should raise the same error.
sudo docker-compose up # Should start doing things.
If the first command fails, but the second succeeds, then you need to add your user to the docker group:

sudo usermod -a -G docker your_user_name
After that, you should logout and login again (user groups are refreshed after the login). The problem should be solved at this step.

If logging out does not help, restarting the computer should.

Node & Yarn
Install Node (requires version v18.18.0). Since our team attempts to always use the latest LTS version of Node.js, we suggest you to install nvm. It will allow you to update Node.js version easily in the future (by running nvm use in the root of the repository)
Install yarn (make sure to get version 1.22.19 - you can change the version by running yarn set version 1.22.19). Instructions can be found on the official site.
Check if yarn is installed by running yarn -v. If you face any problems when installing yarn, it might be the case that your package manager installed the wrong package.Make sure to thoroughly follow the instructions above on the official website. It contains a lot of troubleshooting guides in it.
Axel
Install axel for downloading keys:

On mac:

brew install axel
On debian-based linux:

sudo apt-get install axel
Check the version of axel with the following command:

axel --version
Make sure the version is higher than 2.17.10.

clang
In order to compile RocksDB, you must have LLVM available. On debian-based linux it can be installed as follows:

On linux:

sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config cmake clang lldb lld
On mac:

You need to have an up-to-date Xcode. You can install it directly from App Store. With Xcode command line tools, you get the Clang compiler installed by default. Thus, having XCode you don't need to install clang.

OpenSSL
Install OpenSSL:

On mac:

brew install openssl
On linux:

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
Rust
Install the latest rust version.

Instructions can be found on the official site.

Verify the rust installation:

rustc --version
rustc 1.xx.y (xxxxxx 20xx-yy-zz) # Output may vary depending on actual version of rust
If you are using MacOS with ARM processor (e.g. M1/M2), make sure that you use an aarch64 toolchain. For example, when you run rustup show, you should see a similar input:

rustup show
Default host: aarch64-apple-darwin
rustup home:  /Users/user/.rustup

installed toolchains
--------------------

...

active toolchain
----------------

1.67.1-aarch64-apple-darwin (overridden by '/Users/user/workspace/zksync-era/rust-toolchain')
If you see x86_64 mentioned in the output, probably you're running (or used to run) your IDE/terminal in Rosetta. If that's the case, you should probably change the way you run terminal, and/or reinstall your IDE, and then reinstall the Rust toolchain as well.

Postgres
Install the latest postgres:

On mac:

brew install postgresql@14
On linux:

sudo apt-get install postgresql
Cargo nextest
cargo-nextest is the next-generation test runner for Rust projects. zk test rust uses cargo nextest by default.

cargo install cargo-nextest
SQLx CLI
SQLx is a Rust library we use to interact with Postgres, and its CLI is used to manage DB migrations and support several features of the library.

cargo install sqlx-cli --version 0.5.13
Solidity compiler solc
Install the latest solidity compiler.

brew install solidity
Alternatively, download a precompiled version and add it to your PATH.

Python
Most environments will have this preinstalled but if not, install Python.

Easier method using nix
Nix is a tool that can fetch exactly the right dependencies specified via hashes. The current config is Linux-only but it is likely that it can be adapted to Mac.

Install nix. Enable the nix command and flakes.

Install docker, rustup and use rust to install SQLx CLI like described above. If you are on NixOS, you also need to enable nix-ld.

Go to the zksync folder and run nix develop --impure. After it finishes, you are in a shell that has all the dependencies.

Environment
Edit the lines below and add them to your shell profile file (e.g. ~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc):

# Add path here:
export ZKSYNC_HOME=/path/to/zksync

export PATH=$ZKSYNC_HOME/bin:$PATH

# If you're like me, uncomment:
# cd $ZKSYNC_HOME
Tip: mold
Optionally, you may want to optimize the build time with the modern linker, mold.

This linker will speed up the build times, which can be pretty big for Rust binaries.

Follow the instructions in the repo in order to install it and enable for Rust.

Tip: Speeding up building RocksDB
By default, each time you compile rocksdb crate, it will compile required C++ sources from scratch. It can be avoided by using precompiled versions of library, and it will significantly improve your build times.

In order to do so, you can put compiled libraries to some persistent location, and add the following to your shell configuration file (e.g. .zshrc or .bashrc):

export ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR=<library location>
export SNAPPY_LIB_DIR=<library location>
Make sure that compiled libraries match the current version of RocksDB. One way to obtain them, is to compile the project in the usual way once, and then take built libraries from target/{debug,release}/build/librocksdb-sys-{some random1Node.jspackage.Makenpm update @coinbase/wallet-sdk{

Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.
Java Community Process Program Overview
The Java Community Process (JCP) program is the formalization of the open, inclusive
process that has been used since 1998 to develop and revise Java technology specifications,
reference implementations (RI), and technology compatibility kits (TCK). Jav1300https://github.com/bradford80USA/unamed/actions/workflows/azure-container-webapp.yml1998350Program13003501998

The training experience of DeepSpeed-VisualChat is straightforward and convenient. Here we give an example based on the CLIP visual encoder and the LLaMa-7B model:

git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples.git
cd DeepSpeedExamples/applications/DeepSpeed-VisualChat/
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd training
bash training_scripts/run_7b.sh
The trained checkpoint will be automatically saved in a Hugging Face-compatible version and can be used to launch your own visual chat API:

cd ../chat
bash chat_scripts/run.sh # You need to change necessary variables, e.g, ckpt path
To support larger model inference, we have incorporated Hugging Face large model inference into our DeepSpeed-VisualChat API. Therefore, users can choose a different number of GPUs based on the GPU memory capacity and the model size.

1. Overview
Large Language models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLaMa, have showcased exceptional prowess in a myriad of text generation and comprehension tasks, especially when subjected to zero-/few-shot learning, particularly after instructed fine-tuning. However, to equip AI agents for diverse tasks, one critical feature that needs to be incorporated is multi-modal capability; for instance, the AI agent should be able to read images, hear voices, watch videos, etc. This capability is largely absent in solely text-based LLMs.

Recently, one of the research/practice mainstreams has begun exploring the incorporation of visual capability into LLMs, especially enabling LLMs to understand images by inserting raw pictures (referred to as large visual language models, or LVLMs in short).

The main caveats of the majority of existing works are:

The focus is predominantly on tasks related to a single image, such as visual question answering and captioning, or on handling multiple images that require concurrent input. Neither approach adeptly manages interleaved image-and-text input.
The scalability of the system is limited to models with ~10B parameters, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than largest open-sourced models.
However, for a genuine AI chat agent, the content of inputs could be multiple images interleaved with text, a situation rarely addressed by current works. Also, the generation capability of LLMs grows quickly as the model size increases. Therefore, focusing system capability on ~10B models limits further exploration of the potential of LVLMs.

To resolve these issues, we are introducing DeepSpeed-VisualChat (see arxiv report for more details) with the following new features:

Fully Open-Sourced Multi-round Multi-image Framework with Unprecedented Scalability: DeepSpeed-VisualChat, one of the pioneering fully open-sourced frameworks, enables multi-round and multi-image dialogues, accommodating interleaved text-and-image inputs. We leverage DeepSpeed to enhance our training with a 2B visual encoder and a 70B LLaMA-2 decoder model, illustrating the remarkable scalability of our framework.
Multi-Modal Causal Attention (MMCA) We devise a novel MMCA for multi-modal models that computes attention weights independently across various modalities. MMCA achieves objectives analogous to conventional cross-attention mechanisms but offers enhanced causal attention interpretations for generative tasks, eliminating the need for additional modules or parameters. It also presents superior training data efficiency compared to standard causal attention.
Data Blending for Interleaved Inputs To facilitate conversations with interleaved modalities, DeepSpeed-VisualChat employs assorted data blending techniques on existing datasets, overcoming the shortage of interleaved text-and-image inputs in most available open-source datasets.
