[GitHub Actions Importer](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/migrating-to-github-actions/automating-migration-with-github-actions-importer) helps plan, test, and automate the migration of Azure DevOps, CircleCI, GitLab, Jenkins, and Travis CI pipelines to GitHub Actions. This repository contains learning paths that teach you how to use GitHub Actions Importer and how to approach migrations to Actions.

## Choose your learning path

To get started:

1. Use the `actions/importer-labs` repository as a template to [generate](https://github.com/actions/importer-labs/generate) a new GitHub repository.
2. Choose where to start. There are currently learning paths for:
   - [Migrating from Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions](/azure_devops/readme.md)
   - [Migrating from CircleCI to GitHub Actions](/circle_ci/readme.md)
   - [Migrating from GitLab to GitHub Actions](/gitlab/readme.md)
   - [Migrating from Jenkins to GitHub Actions](/jenkins/readme.md)
   - [Migrating from Travis CI to GitHub Actions](/travis/readme.md)
3. Each learning path describes how to configure your codespace, bootstrap a CI/CD environment, and troubleshoot GitHub Actions Importer.
