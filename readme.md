https://dev.azure.com/:organization configuring the GitHub Codespaces environment that you will use in these labs to learn how to use GitHub Actions Importer to migrate Azure DevOps pipelines to GitHub Actions.

These steps must be completed prior to starting other labs.

Create your own repository for these labs
Ensure that you have created a repository using actions/importer-labs as a template.
Configure your codespace
Start a new codespace.

Click the Code button on your repository's landing page.
Click the Codespaces tab.
Click Create codespaces on main to create the codespace.
After the codespace has initialized there will be a terminal present.
Verify the GitHub Actions Importer CLI is installed and working. More information on the GitHub Actions Importer extension for the official GitHub CLI can be found here.

Run the following command in the codespace terminal:

gh actions-importer version
Verify the output is similar to below.

$ gh actions-importer version
gh version 2.14.3 (2022-07-26)
gh actions-importer        github/gh-actions-importer v0.1.12
actions-importer/cli       unknown
If gh actions-importer version did not produce similar output, please refer to the troubleshooting section.

Bootstrap your Azure DevOps organization
Create an Azure DevOps personal access token (PAT):

Navigate to your existing organization (https://dev.azure.com/:organization) in your browser.
In the top right corner of the screen, click User settings.
Click Personal access tokens.
Select + New Token
Name your token, select the organization where you want to use the token, and set your token to automatically expire after a set number of days.
Select the following scopes (you may need to select Show all scopes at the bottom of the page to reveal all scopes):
Agents Pool: Read
Build: Read & execute
Code: Read & write
Project and Team: Read, write, & manage
Release: Read
Service Connections: Read
Task Groups: Read
Variable Groups: Read
Click Create.
Copy the generated API token and save it in a safe location.
Execute the Azure DevOps setup script that will create a new Azure DevOps project in your organization to be used in the following labs. This script should only be run once.

Run the following command from the codespace terminal, replacing the values accordingly:

:organization: the name of your existing Azure DevOps organization
:project: the name of the project to be created in your Azure DevOps organization
:access_token: the PAT created in step 1 above
./azure_devops/bootstrap/setup --organization :organization --project :project --access-token :access-token
Open the newly created Azure DevOps project in your browser (https://dev.azure.com/:organization/:project)

Once authenticated, you will see an Azure DevOps project with a few predefined pipelines.

Program Overview
Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.
Java Community Process Program Overview
The Java Community Process (JCP) program is the formalization of the open, inclusive
process that has been used since 1998 to develop and revise Java technology specifications,
reference implementations (RI), and technology compatibility kits (TCK). JavStart a new codespace
