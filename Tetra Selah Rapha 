Program Overview
Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.
Java Community Process Program Overview
The Java Community Process (JCP) program is the formalization of the open, inclusive
process that has been used since 1998 to develop and revise Java technology specifications,
reference implementations (RI), and technology compatibility kits (TCK). Javhttps://github.com/bradford80USA/unamed/actions/workflows/azure-container-webapp.yml**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

    {'ai_snippets': 'Few objects have played a greater role in underscoring the combined power of light, color, and motion than the kaleidoscope. It was invented in 1816, quite by accident, during experiments with the polarization and refraction of light by the Scottish physicist Sir David Brewster (1781–1868). In an early phase of his research, he placed several long mirrors in a narrow brass cylinder to reflect an image as it traveled from its source to the viewer’s eye. When Brewster peered into the tube, he found that it transformed reality in unimaginable ways. He called his invention the “kaleidoscope,” from the Greek words for “beautiful image viewer.” Before Brewster could patent his design, competitors had purloined the concept and were selling inexpensive versions of cardboard and mirror plate to passersby on the street. The invention was an instant success, for it provided the perfect tool for understanding the powers of fancy and for demonstrating how light, color, and motion caught the eye', 'url': 'https://huntington.org/frontiers/2020-spring-summer/kaleidoscope'},
    {'ai_snippets': 'Several of the diagrams that Brewster included had such a strong geometric character that they spurred public interest in an entirely new range of orderly design. The kaleidoscope had its greatest impact on American quilts. Whereas quilt makers on both sides of the Atlantic had traditionally focused on classical subjects or elegant foliage derived from nature, once the device was invented, they created a variety of innovative geometric designs that either emulated a kaleidoscopic view or looked to Brewster’s published diagrams for inspiration. Kaleidoscopes with two mirrors created a pattern that exploded outward from the center toward the edges in a large starburst. This was particularly obvious in the visual lines that radiated outward from the center of the quilt. In quilts of this type, the seams of adjoining wedges replicate where the image abuts a mirror—to create the star. Kaleidoscopes with a three-mirror system, joined together in a 30-60-90-degree triangle, likewise', 'url': 'https://huntington.org/frontiers/2020-spring-summer/kaleidoscope'},

The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens.\nBritish academics were intrigued by the charming images, but the colorful scenes provoked a much stronger response in America. There, the kaleidoscope seemed an ideal tool to whet one’s appetite for learning. This ingenious device would help Americans understand the power of the imagination in ways that were far removed from the literary sources that had long dominated British understanding of the subject.', 'url': 'https://huntington.org/frontiers/2020-spring-summer/kaleidoscope'},
    {'ai_snippets': 'Although kaleidoscopes of two, three, and four mirrors produced their respective designs according to the dictates of geometry, their patterns were open to nearly endless interpretations by the viewer. Equally important, the range of ornament produced by the kaleidoscope embodied a new type of creativity that Joseph Addison had envisioned more than a century before when he observed the human capacity to “fancy to itself Things more Great, Strange, or Beautiful, than the Eye ever saw.” The kaleidoscope’s broad appeal in America helped its middle classes embrace abstract ornament.\nBecoming America: Highlights from the Jonathan and Karin Fielding Collection of Folk Art is available online from the Huntington Store.\nSumpter Priddy is an antiquarian and consultant in Alexandria, Virginia.', 'url': 'https://huntington.org/frontiers/2020-spring-summer/kaleidoscope'},

    {'ai_snippets': 'In addition to producing kaleidoscopes with two mirrors that created stunning explosions with colored glass, makers created examples with three and four mirrors, each of which produced a distinct design. Kaleidoscopes with a three-mirror system, joined together in a 60-60-60-degree triangle, repeated the image at the end of the tunnel time and again in a diagonal grid—thereby assuring that multiple replications of the image were firmly imprinted in the storehouse of memory. Indeed, kaleidoscopes with four mirrors facing inward in a square replicated the image in the center as an eight-pointed star. This produced even further options, not only for quilt makers but also for decorative painters. For example, a box from the Fielding Collection with a pink, green, red, and black palette evokes kaleidoscopic patterns.\nBook cover of Becoming America: Highlights from the Jonathan and Karin Fielding Collection of Folk Art, 2020.

    {'ai_snippets': 'In 1819 Brewster published A Treatise on the Kaleidoscope, in which he presented diagrams of distinct kaleidoscopes—those having two, three, or four mirrors grouped together in the tube—to show how a varied arrangement of mirrors would alter the image. He discussed the device’s ability to produce patterns for household decoration in record time: “It will create, in a single hour, what a thousand artists could not invent in the course of a year.” It could be used for a variety of objects, from stained-glass windows for cathedrals to household carpets and floorcloths. It was no longer necessary to devote significant time to drawing an entire design on paper. Rather, one could sketch a segment of the pattern and rely on the kaleidoscope to quickly expand the design into a variety of options.\nLone Star Quilt—Red, White, and Blue, ca. 1850, glazed cotton, pieced, 96 1/2 × 94 in.

It was only a matter of time before house painters transferred the patterns to canvas fabric to produce eye-catching floorcloths and table covers, expanding Fancy’s influence on American homes from wall to wall.', 'url': 'https://huntington.org/frontiers/2020-spring-summer/kaleidoscope'},

    {'ai_snippets': 'In this way, the kaleidoscope shaped Americans’ expectations for non-representational design and transformed middle-class homesteads. Although British kaleidoscopes were expensive devices made with hollow brass cylinders and highly polished mirrors, Americans were so infatuated by the device that they produced inexpensive examples of pasteboard or tinned sheet iron, and they relied on simple mirror plate rather than polished lenses. Foreign visitors to America were astounded to find that middle-class Americans were inspired by this “philosophical instrument.”', 'url': 'https://huntington.org/frontiers/2020-spring-summer/kaleidoscope'},
    {'ai_snippets': 'Kaleidoscopes were invented in 1816 by David Brewster a Scottish inventor. Sir David Brewster was studying many aspects of physical Sciences including polarization optics and the properties of light. While looking at some objects at the end of 2 mirrors He noticed patterns and colors were recreated and reformed into Beautiful new arrangements. He named this new invention after the greek words meaning beautiful form watcher. kalos, the greek word for beautiful, eodos, the greek word = shape scopeo, the greek word = to look at.\nIn 1817 He patented his idea but is seems a incorrectly worded patent made it easy for others to copy without much in way of legal recourse. David Brewster actually did not see much in way of financial success from this invention as other inventors were aggressive in mass producing this new art form.

These were made with a round base and a rarer 4 footed version.\nMany of the baby boomers remember receiving a toy kaleidoscope as a kid.

An instrument of more significance, the stereoscope, which – though of much later date (1849) – along with the kaleidoscope did more than anything else to popularise his name, was not as has often been asserted the invention of Brewster. Sir Charles Wheatstone discovered its principle and applied it as early as 1838 to the construction of a cumbersome but effective instrument, in which the binocular pictures were made to combine by means of mirrors. A dogged rival of Wheatstone\'s, Brewster was unwilling to credit him with the invention, however, and proposed that the true author of the stereoscope was a Mr. Elliot, a "Teacher of Mathematics" from Edinburgh, who, according to Brewster, had conceived of the principles as early as 1823 and had constructed a lensless and mirrorless prototype in 1839, through which one could view drawn landscape transparencies, since', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brewster'},

David was the third of six children, two daughters and four sons: James (1777–1847), minister at Craig, Ferryden; David; George (1784–1855), minister at Scoonie, Fife; and Patrick (1788–1859), minister at the abbey church, Paisley. At the age of 12, David Brewster matriculated at the University of Edinburgh with the intention of becoming a clergyman. He received his MA in 1800, was licensed as a minister of the Church of Scotland, and then preached around Edinburgh on several occasions. By then, Brewster had already shown a strong inclination for the natural sciences and had established a close association with James Veitch of Inchbonny.

In this lab, you will use the `migrate` command to convert a GitLab pipeline and open a pull request with the equivalent Actions workflow.

## Prerequisites

1. Followed the steps [here](./readme.md#configure-your-codespace) to set up your GitHub Codespaces environment and start a GitLab server.
2. Completed the [configure lab](./1-configure.md#configuring-credentials).
3. Completed the [dry-run lab](./4-dry-run.md).

## Performing a migration

Answer the following questions before running a `migrate` command:

1. What project do you want to migrate?
    - __rails-example__
2. What is the namespace for that project?
    - __actions-importer__
3. Where do you want to store the logs?
    - __tmp/migrate__
4. What is the URL for the GitHub repository to add the workflow to?
    - __this repository__. The URL should should follow the pattern <https://github.com/:owner/:repo> with `:owner` and `:repo` replaced with your values.

### Steps

1. Run the following `migrate` command in the codespace terminal:

    ```bash
    gh actions-importer migrate gitlab --target-url https://github.com/:owner/:repo --output-dir tmp/migrate --namespace actions-importer --project rails-example
    ```

2. The command will write the URL to the pull request that was created when the command succeeds.

    ```console
    $ gh actions-importer migrate gitlab --target-url https://github.com/:owner/:repo --output-dir tmp/migrate
    [2022-08-20 22:08:20] Logs: 'tmp/migrate/log/actions-importer-20220916-014033.log'
    [2022-08-20 22:08:20] Pull request: 'https://github.com/:owner/:repo/pull/1'
    ```

3. Open the generated pull request in a new browser tab.

### Inspect the pull request

The first thing to notice about the pull request is that there is a list of manual steps to complete.

Next, you can inspect the "Files changed" in this pull request and see the converted workflow that is being added. Any additional changes or code reviews that were needed should be done in this pull request.

Finally, you can merge the pull request once your review has completed. You can then view the workflow running by selecting the "Actions" menu in the top navigation bar in GitHub.

At this point, the migration has completed and you have successfully migrated a GitLab pipeline to Actions!

### Next Lab

This concludes all labs for migrating GitLab pipelines to Actions with GitHub Actions Importer!-configure.md#configuring-credentialshttps://github.com/:owner/:repo-dry-run.md2022-08-20 22:08:2020220916-0140https://github.com/:owner/:repohttps://github.com/:owner/:repo/pull/1https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18723510/184960870-590b1a28-422f-4350-9ec0-0423bf7ad445.png# Using custom transformers to customize GitHub Actions Importer's behavior

In this lab we will build upon the `dry-run` command to override GitHub Actions Importer's default behavior and customize the converted workflow using "custom transformers". Custom transformers can be used to:

1. Convert items that are not automatically converted.
2. Convert items that were automatically converted using different actions.
3. Convert environment variable values differently.
4. Convert references to runners to use a different runner name in Actions.

## Prerequisites

1. Followed the steps [here](./readme.md#configure-your-codespace) to set up your GitHub Codespaces environment and bootstrap an Azure DevOps project.
2. Completed the [configure lab](./1-configure.md#configuring-credentials).
3. Completed the [audit lab](./2-audit.md).
4. Completed the [dry-run lab](./4-dry-run.md).

## Perform a dry run

You will perform a dry-run for a pipeline in the bootstrapped Azure DevOps project. Answer the following questions before running this command:

1. What is the id of the pipeline to convert?
    - __:pipeline_id__. This id can be found by:
      - Navigating to the build pipelines in the bootstrapped Azure DevOps project <https://dev.azure.com/:organization/:project/_build>
      - Selecting the pipeline with the name "custom-transformer-example"
      - Inspecting the URL to locate the pipeline id <https://dev.azure.com/:organization/:project/_build?definitionId=:pipeline_id>

2. Where do you want to store the result?
    - __tmp/dry-run__. This can be any path within the working directory from which GitHub Actions Importer commands are executed.

### Steps

1. Navigate to the codespace terminal
2. Run the following command from the root directory:

    ```bash
    gh actions-importer dry-run azure-devops pipeline --pipeline-id :pipeline_id --output-dir tmp/dry-run
    ```

3. The command will list all the files written to disk when the command succeeds.
4. View the converted workflow:
    - Find `tmp/dry-run/pipelines/lab-testing/pipelines/custom-transformer-example/.github/workflows` in the file explorer pane in your codespace.
    - Click `custom-transformer-example.yml` to open.

The converted workflow that is generated can be seen below:

_Note_: You can refer to the previous [lab](./4-dry-run.md) to learn about the fundamentals of the `dry-run` command.

## Custom transformers for build steps

You can use custom transformers to override GitHub Actions Importer's default behavior. In this scenario, you may want to override the behavior for converting `DotnetCoreCLI@2` tasks to support parameters that are glob patterns. Answer the following questions before writing a custom transformer:

1. What is the "identifier" of the step to customize?
    - __DotnetCoreCLI@2__

2. What is the desired Actions syntax to use instead?
      - After some research, you have determined that the following script will provide the desired functionality:

      ```yaml
        - run: shopt -s globstar; for f in ./**/*.csproj; do dotnet build $f --configuration ${{ env.BUILDCONFIGURATION }} ; done
          shell: bash
      ```

Now you can begin to write the custom transformer. Custom transformers use a DSL built on top of Ruby and should be defined in a file with the `.rb` file extension. You can create this file by running the following command in your codespace terminal:

```bash
touch transformers.rb && code transformers.rb
```

To build this custom transformer, you first need to inspect the `item` keyword to programmatically obtain the projects, command, and arguments to use in the `DotNetCoreCLI@2` step.

To do this, you will print `item` to the console. You can achieve this by adding the following custom transformer to `transformers.rb`:

```ruby
transform "DotNetCoreCLI@2" do |item|
  puts "This is the item: #{item}"
end
```

The `transform` method can use any valid ruby syntax and should return a `Hash` that represents the YAML that should be generated for a given step. GitHub Actions Importer will use this method to convert a step with the provided identifier and will use the `item` parameter for the original values configured in Azure DevOps.

Now, you can perform a `dry-run` command with the `--custom-transformers` CLI option. The output of the `dry-run` command should look similar to this:

```console
$ gh actions-importer dry-run azure-devops pipeline --pipeline-id 6 --output-dir tmp/dry-run --custom-transformers transformers.rb
[2022-09-20 18:39:50] Logs: 'tmp/dry-run/log/actions-importer-20220920-183950.log'         
This is the item: {"command"=>"restore", "projects"=>"$(BuildParameters.RESTOREBUILDPROJECTS)"}
This is the item: {"projects"=>"$(BuildParameters.RESTOREBUILDPROJECTS)", "arguments"=>"--configuration $(BUILDCONFIGURATION)"}
[2022-09-20 18:39:51] Output file(s):
[2022-09-20 18:39:51]   tmp/dry-run/pipelines/lab-testing/pipelines/custom-transformer-example/.github/workflows/custom-transformer-example.yml
```

In the above command you will see two instances of `item` printed to the console. This is because there are two `DotNetCoreCLI@2` steps in the pipeline. Each item listed above represents each `DotNetCoreCLI@2` step in the order that they are defined in the pipeline.-audit.mdhttps://dev.azure.com/:organization/:project/_buildhttps://dev.azure.com/:organization/:project/_build?definitionId=:pipeline_id1transformers.rbenv.BUILDCONFIGURATION62022-09-20 18:39:5020220920-18392022-09-20 18:39:51 Job count: **84**

In this lab we will build upon the `dry-run` command to override GitHub Actions Importer's default behavior and customize the converted workflow using "custom transformers". Custom transformers can be used to:

1. Convert items that are not automatically converted.
2. Convert items that were automatically converted using different actions.
3. Convert environment variable values differently.
4. Convert references to runners to use a different runner name in Actions.

## Prerequisites

1. Followed the steps [here](./readme.md#configure-your-codespace) to set up your GitHub Codespaces environment and bootstrap an Azure DevOps project.
2. Completed the [configure lab](./1-configure.md#configuring-credentials).
3. Completed the [audit lab](./2-audit.md).
4. Completed the [dry-run lab](./4-dry-run.md).

## Perform a dry run

You will perform a dry-run for a pipeline in the bootstrapped Azure DevOps project. Answer the following questions before running this command:

1. What is the id of the pipeline to convert?
    - __:pipeline_id__. This id can be found by:
      - Navigating to the build pipelines in the bootstrapped Azure DevOps project <https://dev.azure.com/:organization/:project/_build>
      - Selecting the pipeline with the name "custom-transformer-example"
      - Inspecting the URL to locate the pipeline id <https://dev.azure.com/:organization/:project/_build?definitionId=:pipeline_id>

2. Where do you want to store the result?
    - __tmp/dry-run__. This can be any path within the working directory from which GitHub Actions Importer commands are executed.

### Steps

1. Navigate to the codespace terminal
2. Run the following command from the root directory:

    ```bash
    gh actions-importer dry-run azure-devops pipeline --pipeline-id :pipeline_id --output-dir tmp/dry-run
    ```

3. The command will list all the files written to disk when the command succeeds.
4. View the converted workflow:
    - Find `tmp/dry-run/pipelines/lab-testing/pipelines/custom-transformer-example/.github/workflows` in the file explorer pane in your codespace.
    - Click `custom-transformer-example.yml` to open.

The converted workflow that is generated can be seen below:

<details>
  <summary><em>Converted workflow 👇</em></summary>

```yaml
name: actions-importer-bootstrap/pipelines/custom-transformer-example
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - "*"
env:
  BUILDCONFIGURATION: Release
  BuildParameters_RESTOREBUILDPROJECTS: "**/*.csproj"
jobs:
  Job_1:
    name: Agent job 1
    runs-on:
      - self-hosted
      - mechamachine
    steps:
    - name: checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node 10.16.3
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 10.16.3
    - name: Restore
      run: dotnet restore ${{ env.BuildParameters_RESTOREBUILDPROJECTS }}
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build ${{ env.BuildParameters_RESTOREBUILDPROJECTS }} --configuration ${{ env.BUILDCONFIGURATION }}
```

</details>

_Note_: You can refer to the previous [lab](./4-dry-run.md) to learn about the fundamentals of the `dry-run` command.

## Custom transformers for build steps

You can use custom transformers to override GitHub Actions Importer's default behavior. In this scenario, you may want to override the behavior for converting `DotnetCoreCLI@2` tasks to support parameters that are glob patterns. Answer the following questions before writing a custom transformer:

1. What is the "identifier" of the step to customize?
    - __DotnetCoreCLI@2__

2. What is the desired Actions syntax to use instead?
      - After some research, you have determined that the following script will provide the desired functionality:

      ```yaml
        - run: shopt -s globstar; for f in ./**/*.csproj; do dotnet build $f --configuration ${{ env.BUILDCONFIGURATION }} ; done
          shell: bash
      ```

Now you can begin to write the custom transformer. Custom transformers use a DSL built on top of Ruby and should be defined in a file with the `.rb` file extension. You can create this file by running the following command in your codespace terminal:

```bash
touch transformers.rb && code transformers.rb
```

To build this custom transformer, you first need to inspect the `item` keyword to programmatically obtain the projects, command, and arguments to use in the `DotNetCoreCLI@2` step.

To do this, you will print `item` to the console. You can achieve this by adding the following custom transformer to `transformers.rb`:

```ruby
transform "DotNetCoreCLI@2" do |item|
  puts "This is the item: #{item}"
end
```

The `transform` method can use any valid ruby syntax and should return a `Hash` that represents the YAML that should be generated for a given step. GitHub Actions Importer will use this method to convert a step with the provided identifier and will use the `item` parameter for the original values configured in Azure DevOps.

Now, you can perform a `dry-run` command with the `--custom-transformers` CLI option. The output of the `dry-run` command should look similar to this:

```console
$ gh actions-importer dry-run azure-devops pipeline --pipeline-id 6 --output-dir tmp/dry-run --custom-transformers transformers.rb
[2022-09-20 18:39:50] Logs: 'tmp/dry-run/log/actions-importer-20220920-183950.log'         
This is the item: {"command"=>"restore", "projects"=>"$(BuildParameters.RESTOREBUILDPROJECTS)"}
This is the item: {"projects"=>"$(BuildParameters.RESTOREBUILDPROJECTS)", "arguments"=>"--configuration $(BUILDCONFIGURATION)"}
[2022-09-20 18:39:51] Output file(s):
[2022-09-20 18:39:51]   tmp/dry-run/pipelines/lab-testing/pipelines/custom-transformer-example/.github/workflows/custom-transformer-example.yml
```

In the above command you will see two instances of `item` printed to the console. This is because there are two `DotNetCoreCLI@2` steps in the pipeline. Each item listed above represents each `DotNetCoreCLI@2` step in the order that they are defined in the pipeline.-configure.md#configuring-credentials-audit.md-dry-run.mdhttps://dev.azure.com/:organization/:project/_buildhttps://dev.azure.com/:organization/:project/_build?definitionId=:pipeline_id1env.BUILDCONFIGURATIONtransformers.rb2022-09-20 18:39:5062022-09-20 18:39:5120220920-1839 Job count: **84**

the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.

charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.
The Java Specification Review Process
Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
the timeline.
1. INITIATION: A specification is initiated by one or
more members and approved for development
by the Executive Committee.
2. EARLY DRAFT: A group of experts is formed to
draft the specification for the public, community
and the Executive Committee to review. The
Expert Group uses feedback from the review to
revise the specification.
3. PUBLIC DRAFT: The draft is posted on the Internet
for a second review by the public. The Expert
Group uses the feedback to refine the document.
The Executive Committee decides if the draft
should proceed to the next step. The Specification
Lead ensures that the RI and its associated TCK
are completed before sending the specification to
the Executive Committee for final approval.
Java Community Process Program Overview
The Java Community Process (JCP) program is the formalization of the open, inclusive
process that has been used since 1998 to develop and revise Java technology specifications,
reference implementations (RI), and technology compatibility kits (TCK). Jav

Privileges of Membership
Over 1300 organizations and individuals parti-
cipate in the JCP program. While there are no
obligatory duties, members have the opportunity
to influence the evolution of Java technology
through the development of Java Specification
Requests (JSR).
Members can license their Java specifications
under a variety of licenses, including open source
options. Anyone must be able to create an indepen-
dent implementation as long as they license and pass the
TCK to ensure compatibility. Members must also
make the option available to license the TCK and
RI separately. In addition, individuals, educational
organizations, and qualified nonprofits must have
access to the TCKs free of charge.
Successful Members:
• Review proposed JSRs and drafts
• Submit JSRs
• Nominate themselves or others to serve
on Expert Groups, which create or revise
specifications
• Build independent implementations
• Vote on EC membership ballots
• Nominate themselves for an EC seat
Members of an Expert Group may also:
• Serve as the Specification Lead of an
Expert Group
• Select others to join their Expert Group
• Use feedback from members and the public
to improve the quality of a specification
• Complete a specification, its RI, and its
associated TCK
• Maintain a specification after it is written
How to Become a Member
A person or organization can become a member
by signing the Java Specification Participation
Agreement (JSPA). This agreement between an
organization or individual and Oracle establishes
each member’s rights and obligations when partici-
pating in the JCP program. To cover costs, the JSPA
charges a nominal fee for commercial entities, but it
is free for Java User Groups and individuals.

Currently, over 350 JSRs are in development.
A specification follows four major steps as it
progresses through the process, as shown in
